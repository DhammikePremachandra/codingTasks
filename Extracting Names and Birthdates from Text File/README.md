# Extracting Names and Birthdates from Text File

This program reads data from a text file named "DOB.txt" and extracts 
names and birthdates from each line. It then prints out the extracted 
names and birthdates separately. Finally, it appends the extracted 
data back to the end of the "DOB.txt" file.

## Description

This program is designed to handle data stored in a specific format 
within a text file. Each line in the "DOB.txt" file contains a first 
name, last name, month, day, and year separated by spaces. The program 
reads each line, extracts the name and birthdate, and prints them out 
in two different sections: "Name" and "Birthdate". This functionality 
is useful for processing and organizing data stored in a structured 
format.

Understanding and implementing this program enhances proficiency in 
file I/O operations, string manipulation, and data extraction 
techniques in Python programming. It also demonstrates practical 
skills in handling and processing textual data.

## Installation

No installation is required for this program. Simply clone or 
download the provided source code and run it using a Python 
interpreter (Python 3.x recommended).

## Usage

1. Clone or download the source code to your local machine.
2. Ensure that the "DOB.txt" file containing the data is in the same 
directory as the program.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing the downloaded files.
5. Run the program by executing the following command:
   ```
   python dob_task.py
   ```
6. The program will read the data from "DOB.txt", extract names and 
birthdates, print them out, and append the extracted data back to the 
file.

Feel free to modify the source code or integrate it into your own 
projects as needed.

Enjoy exploring data extraction and manipulation with this practical 
coding task!
