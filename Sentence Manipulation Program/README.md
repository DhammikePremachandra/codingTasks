# Sentence Manipulation Program

This program allows the user to manipulate a sentence provided by the 
user in various ways, such as calculating its length, replacing 
occurrences of the last letter, reversing the order of the last three 
characters, and creating a five-letter word using specific characters 
from the sentence. It's a practical coding task aimed at improving 
proficiency in Python programming, particularly in string manipulation 
and indexing.

## Description

This program provides a solution to the common scenario of 
manipulating a sentence in various ways based on user input. 
It demonstrates string manipulation techniques in Python, including 
calculating the length of a string, replacing characters, and 
extracting substrings. By allowing the user to interactively input a 
sentence and observing the results of different manipulations, the 
program reinforces understanding of string indexing and slicing.

Understanding and implementing this task helps strengthen fundamental 
skills in Python programming, especially in handling strings and 
working with user input. It also fosters problem-solving abilities by 
breaking down a larger task into smaller, manageable steps and 
implementing them using Python's built-in functionalities.

## Installation

No installation is required for this program. Simply clone or download 
the provided source code and run it using Python interpreter 
(Python 3.x recommended).
