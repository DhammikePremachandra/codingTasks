## Description

This program provides a solution for managing student registrations 
for an exam venue. It prompts users to enter the number of students 
they want to register and then collects each student's ID. The entered 
student IDs are appended to a string and stored in the "reg_form.txt" 
file. This task helps improve proficiency in Python programming, 
particularly in handling user inputs, file operations, and string 
manipulation.

## Installation

No installation is required for this program. Simply clone or 
download the provided source code and run it using a Python 
interpreter (Python 3.x recommended).

   ```
5. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the number of students and 
their IDs.
