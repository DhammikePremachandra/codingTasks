# Continuously Calculate Average of User Inputs

This practical coding task involves creating a program that 
continually prompts the user for numbers as input and outputs the 
average of all the numbers entered. It's a fundamental exercise that 
helps improve proficiency in Python programming, particularly in 
handling loops, conditional statements, and basic arithmetic operations.

## Description

This program provides a simple solution to the task of continuously 
calculating the average of user inputs. It utilizes a while loop to 
repeatedly request numbers from the user until they choose to exit by 
entering -1. As each number is inputted, it is added to a running 
total, and the count of inputs is incremented. Upon exiting the loop, 
the program calculates and displays the average of all the numbers 
entered.

Understanding and implementing this task helps reinforce key concepts 
such as loop iteration, user input handling, and basic arithmetic 
operations in Python programming. It also demonstrates the practical 
application of programming skills in solving real-world problems.

## Installation

No installation is required for this program. Simply clone or download 
the provided source code and run it using a Python interpreter (Python 
3.x recommended).

## Usage

1. Clone or download the source code to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the downloaded files.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the program by executing the following command:
   ```
   python while.py
   ```
5. Follow the prompts to enter numbers. Enter -1 to exit and calculate 
the average.
6. The program will output the average of all the numbers entered by 
the user.

Feel free to modify the source code or integrate it into your own 
projects as needed.

Enjoy exploring the world of Python programming with this practical 
coding task!
