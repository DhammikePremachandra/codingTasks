## Description

This program prompts the user to input three different integers and 
then performs the following operations:
- Calculates the sum of all three numbers.
- Subtracts the second number from the first number.
- Multiplies the third number by the first number.
- Divides the sum of all three numbers by the third number.

By completing this task, I reinforced my understanding of basic 
input/output operations, arithmetic calculations, and variable 
manipulation in Python programming. It's an essential skill for 
building foundational knowledge in programming and problem-solving.
