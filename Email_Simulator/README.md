## Description

This program provides a simple email inbox simulation where users can 
interact with emails, mark them as read, and view unread emails. It 
demonstrates basic concepts of OOP in Python, such as class creation, 
object instantiation, and method implementation. By working with email 
objects and manipulating their properties, users gain a better 
understanding of how to model real-world systems using classes and 
objects.

## Installation
