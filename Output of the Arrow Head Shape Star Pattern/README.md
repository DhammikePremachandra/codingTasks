## Description

The script generates an arrow head shape star pattern, consisting of 
rows of stars where the number of stars increases up to a certain 
point and then decreases. The maximum number of stars in a row is 
defined by the variable `max_stars_row`. The script utilizes a `for` 
loop to iterate through a range of numbers, generating stars based on 
the current iteration. Conditional statements are used to determine 
whether to increase or decrease the number of stars in each row.

## Installation

No installation is required for this script. Simply clone or download 
the provided source code and run it using a Python interpreter 
(Python 3.x recommended).

## Usage

1. Clone or download the source code to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the downloaded files.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the script by executing the following command:
   ```
   python pattern.py
   ```
5. The script will output the arrow head shape star pattern.

Feel free to modify the source code or integrate it into your own 
projects as needed.

Enjoy exploring the world of Python programming with this practical 
coding task!
